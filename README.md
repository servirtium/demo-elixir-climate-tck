Note - The World Bank took down their climate WebAPI. Darn it. We now depend on a docker version of the same until we work out what to do long term. Docker build and deploy this locally - https://github.com/servirtium/worldbank-climate-recordings - see README

TL;DR:

```
docker build git@github.com:servirtium/worldbank-climate-recordings.git#main -t worldbank-weather-api-for-servirtium-development
docker run -d -p 4567:4567 worldbank-weather-api-for-servirtium-development
```

The build for this demo project needs that docker container running
